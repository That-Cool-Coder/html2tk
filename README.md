# html2tk

Use HTML to create your Python Tkinter applications instead of hard-coding widgets.

This is not designed as a way to display existing HTML applications in Python (use something like Electron for that). It is simply. While currently html2tk is not capable of creating complex layouts, it is ideal for small-to-medium projects.

Currently there is no documentation for users as the project is not yet ready for use and is volatile.

There is also no external documentation for maintainers, but docstrings have been added to most functions explaining syntax, use and behavior.
